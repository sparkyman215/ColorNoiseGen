# ColorNoiseGen
What is this? This is a simple java project I made while bored at work. What it does is pick numbers to decide a RGB color code for a pixel in the top left corner of the image, and then continue picking colors by averaging the four edges of each pixel and adding a random seed for some variation. It's not perfect, it's not pretty, it's not good, but it does some things sometimes.
